# NeckMuscleLoad
This repository includes the code for modeling multisensory integration across reference frames during reach movements 
Three different head roll and neck load condition are considered in the code (based on the experimental setup,3by3 design)
Head roll: 30deg CW, straight, and 30deg CCW

To get the simulation results first run the MonteCarlo_v6_3
Then to get the visual plots run the Plot_Results_v2_1
the two other files contains the required functions for MonteCarlo simulation
